# Museum-DigitalSlideShow
Simple Image slideshow to run off of a Raspberry Pi for a museum. 

This application is created as a solution to a Processing based exhibit that a museum was having issues with random freezing and crashing.
The main goal is to lower memory usage, provide a more stable and configurable platform for their exhibit. 

Additionally it can allow for more transitions and images then the previous implmentation.
